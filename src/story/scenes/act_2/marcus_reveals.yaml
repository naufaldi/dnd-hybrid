  Marcus glances around nervously before continuing.

  "The cult in your dungeon - they weren't trying to summon something.
  They were trying to UN-summon. To release whatever Vexillion
  locked away."

  He lowers his voice. "Folk are saying that the old wizard sealed
  himself with the entity - that he's still alive, somewhere between
  worlds. And now that the seal is weakened..."

  He shakes his head. "Forget I said anything. Keep your weapons
  sharp and your eyes open."
