title: "The Shadow Entity"

description: |
  Elara speaks in hushed tones, as if the walls themselves might hear.

  "The entity is old - older than the kingdom. Vexillion called it
  the Hollow King. It's a being of shadow and hunger, trapped between
  dimensions. The cult wanted to use its power. I wanted to keep it
  sealed forever."

  "But seals require maintenance. The dungeon where you fought - it's
  a focal point of the seal. When the cult disrupted it, I felt the
  balance shift. The Hollow King stirs in its prison."

  "To truly strengthen the seal, we'd need artifacts from three locations:
  the tower archives, the old shrine in the northern woods, and...
  from the heart of the dungeon itself."
