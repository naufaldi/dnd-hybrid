title: "The Bandit Problem"

description: |
  Sergeant Bron's weathered face grows serious.

  "Three weeks ago, bandits started raiding the northern farms. They take
  food, livestock, anything of value. But here's the strange part - they
  never kill. That's not how bandits work."

  He taps the map. "We tracked them to an old fort - the Ruins of Thornkeep.
  But our scouts report they're better organized than any bandit camp.
  Someone is training them. Leading them."

  "I could use a hero who already proved themselves against dark cultists.
  Will you investigate?"
