description: |
  Dust motes dance in shafts of light as you explore the collapsed
  bookshelves. Many scrolls have rotted, but some remain intact.

  Elara runs her fingers along the spines. "These are Vexillion's
  research notes. He was studying the nature of the seal itself."

  A particular tome catches her eye - "The Binding of Hungry Shadows."
