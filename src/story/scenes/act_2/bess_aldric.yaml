  Bess lowers her voice further. "The stranger? Haven't seen him in weeks.
  Left town right after the dungeon business. Didn't say where he was going."

  She wipes the bar. "Quiet fellow. Paid his tab, helped with the heavy
  barrels once. Never caused trouble. But there was something about him -
  like he was carrying a weight no one else could see."

  "If you're looking for him, I'd try the old roads north. Or the temple
  ruins. Places folk like him go when they need to disappear."
