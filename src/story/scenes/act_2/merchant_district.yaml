title: "Merchant District"

description: |
  The merchant district is a feast for the senses. Rugs from distant lands hang
  from tent poles, exotic spices perfume the air, and merchants call out their
  deals in a dozen different accents.

  Marcus's Trading Post stands out - a sturdy wagon converted into a permanent
  shop. The portly halfling merchant counts his coins behind the counter,
  his sharp eyes watching for potential customers - or thieves.

  Other vendors sell weapons, armor, potions, and curious trinkets.
