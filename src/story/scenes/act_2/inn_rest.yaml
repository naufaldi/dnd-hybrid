title: "A Night's Rest"

description: |
  The room is simple but clean - a bed, a washbasin, and a window
  overlooking the town square. For the first time in weeks, you
  sleep without nightmares.

  You wake refreshed, your wounds healed and your spirits lifted.
  Bess included a breakfast of bread and honey in the room rate.
