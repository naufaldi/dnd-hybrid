description: |
  The tower's interior is dusty but intact. Scrolls line the walls in
  collapsed bookshelves, and faint magical residue clings to the stone.

  "The library was once my master's pride," Elara says, running her fingers
  along a tome's spine. "He studied the nature of the seal you helped restore.
  There may be answers here - or dangers."

  A door leads deeper into the tower. Stairs spiral upward into darkness.
