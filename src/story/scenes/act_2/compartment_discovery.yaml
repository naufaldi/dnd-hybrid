title: "The Hidden Compartment"

description: |
  Behind the mirror, you find a hidden compartment. Inside is a
  small crystal orb that pulses with inner light - and a note in
  Vexillion's hand:

  "To whoever finds this: the seal cannot be maintained forever.
  The Hollow King grows stronger. If you read this, the final
  ritual must be performed at the original seal site. May the gods
  forgive us for what we've unleashed."

  Elara takes the orb carefully. "A scrying crystal. It will help
  us find the other artifacts we need."
