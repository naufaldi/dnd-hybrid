title: "The Bard's Tale"

description: |
  The bard's voice fills the inn, telling of heroes and monsters.
  But tonight, he sings of something new - a tale of shadows and seal,
  of cultists and a hero who walked into darkness.

  It's the story of your adventure in the dungeon. The crowd
  listens with wide eyes, none knowing the hero sits among them.

  When the song ends, the bard catches your eye and raises
  his cup in silent salute.
