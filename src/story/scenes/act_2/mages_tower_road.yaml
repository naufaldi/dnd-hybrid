title: "The Old Road"

description: |
  The eastern road winds through overgrown fields, the ruins of old farms
  visible through the trees. It has been years since anyone cultivated this land.

  Ahead, the tower rises against the sky - a once-grand structure of white
  stone, now marred by weathering and neglect. Vines creep up its walls,
  and windows that once glowed with arcane light are now dark and empty.

  A woman stands at the base of the tower, looking up at its heights.
