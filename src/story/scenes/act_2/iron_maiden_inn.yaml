title: "The Iron Maiden Inn"

description: |
  The Iron Maiden Inn is warm with firelight and the sound of lute music.
  Townsfolk gather at heavy wooden tables, sharing tales and ale. The smell
  of roasting mutton makes your stomach growl.

  The innkeeper, a sturdy woman named Bess, moves between tables with practiced
  ease. A bard in the corner sings of distant adventures - perhaps your
  own exploits will grace such songs one day.

  In a quiet booth, a hooded figure sits alone, nursing a drink.
