  Marcus's eyes light up as you approach. "Ah, a customer! And not just
  any customer - the hero of Millbrook! What can I do for you today?"

  His shop is packed with curiosities: enchanted gems that glow faintly,
  maps to places best left unvisited, potions of various colors, and
  mundane goods for everyday adventuring.

  "I've got some new stock since last you visited. Take a look!"
