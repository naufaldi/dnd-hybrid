description: |
  Bess's expression darkens. "The raids? Bad business. North of here,
  near Thornkeep. Bandits - or something worse. Good folk losing
  livestock, grain stores emptied. A few farmers have gone missing."

  She leans in. "The guard's stretched thin. Sergeant Bron's been
  asking for volunteers to scout the area. Says he'll pay well for
  anyone who can bring back information - or put an end to it."

  "You being a hero and all, you might be just what they need."
