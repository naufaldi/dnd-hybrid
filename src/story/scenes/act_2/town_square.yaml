title: "Town Square"

description: |
  The sun casts golden light across the cobblestones of Millbrook's town square.
  Merchants hawk their wares from colorful stalls, children chase each other between
  the fountain and the bakery, and the smell of fresh bread mingles with the
  scent of horse from the stable.

  Weeks have passed since your victory in the dungeon. The cult has been routed,
  and the ancient evil sealed away. But peace brings new challenges.

  To the north stands the Guard Barracks, where Sergeant Bron oversees the town's
  defense. The Iron Maiden Inn offers warmth and news. To the east, the merchant
  district bustles with activity. Beyond the eastern gate, the old road leads to
  the abandoned mages tower.

  The fountain at the center depicts a hero slaying a dragon - an unfamiliar face.
  Perhaps they will add your likeness one day.
