title: "A Quiet Ale"

description: |
  Bess slides a foaming mug across the bar. "On the house. Hero's discount."

  The ale is cool and bitter, exactly what you need. Around you, the
  inn hums with conversation - merchants discussing routes, guards
  swapping stories, a group of travelers planning their next move.

  For a moment, you can almost forget the darkness you faced below.
  Almost.
