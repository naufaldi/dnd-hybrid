title: "Elara's Story"

description: |
  Elara's eyes grow distant, haunted by memories.

  "I was Vexillion's apprentice for fifteen years. He was brilliant -
  a scholar of ancient seals and binding magic. The cult in your dungeon?
  They were trying to contact something he had sealed away long ago."

  She grips her staff tighter. "When I realized what they were doing,
  I tried to stop them. But I was too late. Vexillion... he sealed
  himself with the entity to keep it contained. He's either dead or
  trapped forever."

  "But the seal weakens. And someone is directing those bandits -
  I believe they're trying to weaken the seal from outside while
  the cult tried to break it from within."

  "Will you help me find a way to strengthen the seal?"
