title: "The Road to Thornkeep"

description: |
  The old fort of Thornkeep rises against the evening sky, its weathered
  walls bearing the scars of ancient wars. Torches flicker on the walls -
  these aren't ordinary bandits.

  You approach through the overgrown forest, noting the strategic positions
  of the guard posts. Someone with military training organized this camp.

  A single path leads to the main gate. To the side, you notice a drainage
  ditch that might provide another way in.
