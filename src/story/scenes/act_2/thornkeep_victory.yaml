title: "Victory at Thornkeep"

description: |
  The bandits scatter or surrender. In the captain's quarters, you find
  evidence that ties these raiders to someone in town - letters sealed
  with a strange mark.

  Among the loot, you find a share of stolen goods and the captain's
  journal. Entries mention "the Master" and plans for something called
  "the Hollowing."

  You've solved the bandit problem, but revealed something larger.
