title: "The Guard Barracks"

description: |
  The guard barracks is a sturdy stone building that has protected Millbrook for
  generations. Shields and pikes line the walls, and the hearth in the corner
  crackles warmly.

  Sergeant Bron stands by the planning table, studying a map of the surrounding
  countryside. He's a grizzled veteran with a magnificent gray beard and keen
  eyes that have seen too much war.

  "Ah, it's the hero of the dungeon," he says, looking up. "Good timing.
  We have a problem."

  He gestures to the map. "Bandits have been raiding the northern farms.
  But there's something strange about them - they move too strategically
  for simple outlaws."
