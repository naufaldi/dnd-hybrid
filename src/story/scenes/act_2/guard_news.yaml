  "Well, aside from the bandit problem, things have been quiet. The
  farm raids started about three weeks ago. Before that, it was

  dungeon was working alone. There are echoes of old magic in the
  bandit camps - arcane symbols our scouts found. Someone with power
  is directing them."

  "Keep your eyes open out there, hero. The fight might not be over."
