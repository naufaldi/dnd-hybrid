  Marcus leans in conspiratorially.

  "Well, I hear things. Merchant's privilege, you know. There's talk of
  strange lights in the hills to the north - not bandits, something else.
  And the scholars at the tower have been very interested in what came
  out of that dungeon of yours."

  He pauses, weighing whether to say more.

  "Between us? I think the bigger threat isn't the cultists - it's what
  they were trying to summon. And if what they were calling truly
  exists..."

  He shakes his head. "But that's just old merchant's gossip. Ignore me."
