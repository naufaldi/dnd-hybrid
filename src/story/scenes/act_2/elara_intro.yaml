  The woman turns as you approach. She's younger than you expected - perhaps
  thirty winters - with silver-streaked auburn hair and eyes that seem to
  hold distant thunderstorms.

  "I am Elara," she says, her voice carrying the cadence of scholarly
  refinement. "Former apprentice to Archmage Vexillion, keeper of this tower's
  legacy."

  She studies you with unexpected intensity. "You are the one who defeated
  the cultists in the dark dungeon. I felt the seal being placed - a
  disturbance in the magical currents."

  "This tower holds secrets that could help or harm Millbrook. Will you
  help me explore it?"
