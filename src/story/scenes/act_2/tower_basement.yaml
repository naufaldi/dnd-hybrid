title: "The Tower Basement"

description: |
  The basement stairs descend into darkness. Elara lights a magical
  orb that casts eerie shadows on the walls.

  The room below is a laboratory - tables covered in strange
  instruments, arcane circles drawn on the floor, and...

  A cage in the corner. Something was kept here. Recently.

  "Vexillion was experimenting," Elara whispers. "He wasn't just
  studying the seal. He was trying to understand it."
