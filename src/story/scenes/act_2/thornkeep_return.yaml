description: |
  Sergeant Bron listens to your report with growing concern. He examines
  the letters you found, his face growing grim.

  "The Hollowing... I feared this was connected." He looks up.
  "These aren't just bandits. They're cultists - followers of the
  same darkness you defeated in the dungeon."

  "You've done well, hero. But I fear the battle is just beginning."
