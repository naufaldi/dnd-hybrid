title: "The Tower's Peak"

description: |
  The spiral stairs lead up, up, into the tower's highest reaches.
  Here, the windows are intact, and moonlight streams through,
  illuminating dust and debris.

  This was Vexillion's private study. A desk holds papers,
  a telescope points at the stars, and a mirror on the wall
  shows... nothing. The reflection seems delayed.

  "His scrying mirror," Elara says. "It's broken now. But look -
  there's a hidden compartment."
