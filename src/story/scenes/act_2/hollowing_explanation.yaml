title: "The Hollowing"

description: |
  Sergeant Bron's face grows dark.

  "The Hollowing is what happens when the seal fails completely.
  The Hollow King - an entity of pure hunger - begins to spread
  its influence. It doesn't conquer with armies. It consumes.
  Dreams. Lives. Hope itself."

  "Your dungeon - it was one of several anchor points for the seal.
  When the cult disrupted it, the first cracks appeared. These
  bandits? They're victims. The Hollowing reaches into minds,
  twists desperate people into servants."

  "If the other anchor points fail... Millbrook will be the first
  to fall. Then the kingdom. Then everything."
