  Bess wipes a mug as she talks, her voice low.

  "It's been quiet since the dungeon, but quiet worries me more than
  trouble. The farm raids to the north have folks scared. And there's
  talk of strange lights near the old mages tower."

  She sets down the mug. "That tower's been empty for years - since
  Archmage Vexillion vanished. Some say he's still in there, mad with
  arcane power. Others say something worse moved in."

  "You being a hero and all - folks would feel safer if you looked
  into it. But no pressure."
