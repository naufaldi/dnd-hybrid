title: "The Hidden Dangers"

description: |
  Your keen eyes catch the telltale signs - a slight irregularity in the
  stonework, dust disturbed in an unnatural pattern.

  You crouch low and examine the floor carefully. Yes - pressure plates,
  connected to blade traps. The old temple's defenders still function.

  More importantly, you spot a safe path through - a narrow strip along
  the eastern wall where the traps don't reach.
