title: "Greedy Goblins"

description: |
  You hold up ten gold coins. The goblins' eyes go wide with greed.

  "GOLD! Real gold!" The lead goblin snatches the coins from your hand,
  biting one to test its authenticity.

  "Okay, okay! You pass! But only you - not follow us!"
  He gestures for the other goblins to part.

  "We guard here for master. You go deep, you find master. He be VERY
  angry if we let you pass... but we never saw you!"

  The path ahead clears.
