title: "The Dark Shrine"

description: |
  You enter the heart of the ancient temple. The chamber is vast, lit by
  unnatural purple flames that cast writhing shadows on the walls.

  At the center stands a shrine - a twisted altar of black stone. Behind it,
  a hooded figure conducts a ritual around a pulsing orb of darkness.

  The Void Heart.

  The cultist leader turns as you enter. His eyes burn with fanatical zeal.

  "ANOTHER HERO!" he screams. "Kill him!"

  Two goblin guards charge at you! The cultist returns to his ritual -
  if you don't stop him soon, the Void Heart will awaken.
