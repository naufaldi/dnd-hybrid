title: "A Costly Oversight"

description: |
  You scan the entrance carefully, but your eyes deceive you. The ancient
  traps of the temple are masterfully hidden - centuries of dust have
  obscured their mechanisms.

  Confident the path is safe, you step forward.

  The floor gives way beneath your feet.

  You plunge into a pit trap, landing hard on stone. Pain shoots through
  your ankle as you hit the bottom - a twisted sprain, but nothing broken.

  Above, you can see the entrance, now impossibly far above you.

  The pit is about ten feet deep with smooth walls. You'll need to find
  another way out.
