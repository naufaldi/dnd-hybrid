title: "Goblins Don't Negotiate"

description: |
  Your negotiation attempt fails. The lead goblin's face twists into a
  malicious grin.

  "Stupid human think goblins stupid? NO! We smart! We take your gold
  AND your stuff!"

  The goblins charge! The first swings its scimitar at you while the
  second readies its bow.
