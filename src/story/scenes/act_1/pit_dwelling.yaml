title: "The Pit Dweller"

description: |
  Your voice echoes in the darkness of the pit. For a long moment, nothing responds.

  Then, a pair of glowing yellow eyes open in the shadows. A hunched figure emerges
  from the gloom—an emaciated creature that has clearly lived in this pit for years.
  Its rags hang in tatters, and its voice is like gravel scraping stone.

  "More victims... or perhaps... salvation?" it rasps. "I am called the Pit Dweller.
  I know these tunnels better than any living soul. Help me escape this place, and
  I will show you the way to the dungeon's heart."
