title: "Setting the Trap"

description: |
  You quickly survey the entrance, looking for good ambush positions. The
  narrow passage offers several options - loose stones that could be pushed,
  a ledge above the entrance, or simply hiding in the shadows.
  
  You prepare your trap and settle in to wait. The goblins' cackling voices
  echo from within, growing louder as they approach.
  
  "Come, come!" one calls out. "Fresh meat for the master!"
  
  They're nearly here. Your ambush is ready.
