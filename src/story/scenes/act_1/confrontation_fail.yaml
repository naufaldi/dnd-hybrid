description: |
  You attempt to press for more information, but the stranger's expression
  hardens instantly.

  "I offered you a gift," he says coldly. "Not an interrogation. If you cannot
  trust a simple question answered in good faith, perhaps you are not the hero
  this town needs."

  He stands, pocketing the map.

  "Forget the dungeon. Some secrets are better left buried."

  Before you can respond, he disappears into the crowd, leaving you alone
  with your questions.
