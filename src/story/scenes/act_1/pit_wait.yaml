description: |
  You wait in the darkness of the pit. Time seems to stretch endlessly as
  you sit in the damp darkness.

  Eventually, you hear voices above—the guards have given up their search.
  But you also hear something else: the sound of water dripping somewhere
  nearby. There might be another way out.
