title: "Victory!"

description: |
  The last goblin falls with a gurgling cry. You stand amid the defeated foes,
  breathing heavily but victorious.
  
  Looking over the bodies, you find a few coins and a crude map scratched onto
  parchment. The map shows additional passages deeper into the dungeon.
