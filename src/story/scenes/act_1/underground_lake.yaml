title: "The Underground Lake"

description: |
  You follow the sound of water through a winding passage. The tunnel opens
  into a vast underground cavern containing a black, still lake.
  
  Bioluminescent mushrooms cling to the cavern walls, casting an eerie blue-green
  glow across the water's surface. The air here is noticeably cooler and fresher.
  
  Near the water's edge, you notice:
  - A small, rusted lockbox caught on a rock
  - Tracks leading to and from the water
  - A rickety wooden dock in poor condition
