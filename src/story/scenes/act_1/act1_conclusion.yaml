description: |
  You emerge from the dungeon into daylight. The entrance glows with the
  first rays of dawn.

  Behind you, the dungeon entrance shudders - the collapsing temple
  seals itself once more. The cultists are no more, the Void Heart
  destroyed. The darkness that threatened the region has been banished.

  You made it.

  As you walk back toward town, you see figures approaching - the
  townspeople, alerted by your victory. Among them, you spot the
  mysterious stranger from the tavern.

  He nods solemnly.

  "You did what I could not," he says. "Thank you."

  The townspeople cheer as you approach. You are a hero.
