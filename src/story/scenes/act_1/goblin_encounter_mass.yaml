title: "Ambush in the Dark"

description: |
  You charge into the darkness, weapon raised! 
  
  But the goblins were ready for you. Dozens of beady red eyes gleam in the
  torchlight as goblins pour from side passages, cutting off your retreat.
  
  "Foolish human!" their leader cackles from the back. "You walk into our trap!"
  
  You're surrounded, outnumbered at least ten to one. The air fills with
  the stench of goblin sweat and the gleam of rusty weapons.
  
  This will be a desperate fight.
