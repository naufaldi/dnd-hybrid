title: "Ambush Discovered!"

description: |
  You wait in position, heart pounding, as the goblins approach. But just
  as you're about to spring your trap, one of the goblins sniffs the air
  and lets out a warning cry.
  
  "Smell human! SMELL HUMAN!"
  
  Your ambush is ruined! The goblins scatter, then regroup, advancing
  cautiously with weapons drawn. They know you're here now - the element
  of surprise is lost.
  
  "Come out, come out!" their leader calls mockingly. "We find you anyway!"
  
  You're exposed and outnumbered. There's no choice but to fight.
