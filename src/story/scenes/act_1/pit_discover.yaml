description: |
  Searching the pit carefully, your hands brush against something metallic
  embedded in the wall. It's an old iron box, rusted but intact.

  Inside, you find the remains of a previous adventurer—and their belongings.
  A faded note reads: "The Pit Dweller knows the way out. Trust no one."
