title: "A Deadly Trap"

description: |
  Your bold entrance triggers a deadly mechanism! The floor beneath you gives way,
  and you tumble into a spike pit below.
  
  Pain shoots through your body as the spikes pierce your armor. You manage to
  pull yourself up, grievously wounded but alive.
  
  Above, you can see the trap door you fell through. You'll need to find another
  way out of this pit.
