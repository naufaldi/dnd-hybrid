title: "Goblin Ambush!"

description: |
  The passage narrows as you press forward into the dark. Suddenly, you hear
  high-pitched cackling from ahead.
  
  A group of goblins leaps from the shadows! Their green skin is mottled with
  scars and crude tattoos. One carries a jagged scimitar, another a gnarled bow.
  
  "Die, intruder!" the lead goblin shrieks, charging at you!
