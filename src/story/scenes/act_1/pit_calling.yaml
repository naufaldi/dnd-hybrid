description: |
  Your voice carries through the darkness of the pit. The damp walls seem to
  absorb most of the sound, but somewhere in the distance, you hear a response.

  "Who... dares... disturb... the depths?" A hollow, echoing voice drifts up
  from somewhere below. Then silence.

  Moments later, you hear shuffling footsteps above. The trap door opens,
  and a rope is tossed down.

  "The master will want to know about this one..."
