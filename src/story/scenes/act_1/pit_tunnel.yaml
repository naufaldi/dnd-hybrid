description: |
  Following the sound of dripping water, you discover a narrow tunnel hidden
  in the corner of the pit. It's a tight squeeze, but it leads upward.

  After what feels like hours of crawling through the darkness, you emerge
  into a small chamber. Moonlight streams through a crack in the ceiling—
  you're back near the surface!

  But this chamber holds more than just an exit. Ancient markings cover the
  walls, and a pedestal stands in the center with something resting upon it.
