title: "The Entry Hall"

description: |
  You step into the dungeon entrance and find yourself in a spacious hall. 
  Ancient stone pillars line the walls, carved with runes that have long lost their meaning.
  
  The air is thick and stale. Faded tapestries hang from the walls, depicting battles
  between armored knights and twisted creatures.
  
  Three passages branch off from here:
  - To the NORTH, a narrow corridor stretches into darkness
  - To the EAST, you hear the faint sound of dripping water
  - To the WEST, a heavy wooden door stands slightly ajar
