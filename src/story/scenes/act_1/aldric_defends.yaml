  "Blame me?" Aldric laughs, but there's no humor in it. "I tried to warn
  everyone! I tried to seal the temple forever!"
  
  He pulls back his hood, revealing terrible scars that seem to shift and
  move in the candlelight. 
  
  "I was the first to find the Void Heart. I was the one who unleashed
  what sleeps within. Everything that's happened - the disappearances,
  the nightmares, the cult - it's all my fault."
  
  He meets your gaze, and you see genuine pain in his eyes.
  
  "But I can fix it. With your help, I can fix everything. Will you help me
  end this nightmare?"
