title: "Tense Confrontation"

description: |
  You step forward aggressively, trying to intimidate the hooded figure.
  
  "Who are you? Why are you watching me?" you demand, hand on your weapon.
  
  The stranger doesn't flinch. Those gleaming eyes study you with amusement.
  
  "So quick to anger," the stranger murmurs. "The dungeon rewards patience,
  not bravado. But very well - if you wish to test me, let us see who has
  the stronger will."
