  You step aside with the stranger. The crowd's cheers fade as you walk
  toward the edge of the village square.

  He pulls back his hood. Aldric - the fugitive priest, the one who
  unleashed the darkness. His scars seem less terrible in the daylight.

  "You did what I could not," he says quietly. "I tried to warn them.
  I tried to seal the temple. But I was too broken, too afraid."

  He meets your gaze. "Thank you. Not just for the town - for showing me
  that redemption is possible."

  He presses a small pouch into your hand - gold, and a worn journal.
  "My notes. Perhaps they'll help if darkness ever stirs again."

  With a final nod, he melts into the crowd. You never see him leave.
