title: "A Quick Escape"

description: |
  As you stumble back from your failed intimidation attempt, the hooded
  figure slips away with surprising speed. By the time you recover, he's
  vanished into the tavern crowd.
  
  "Gone," the barkeep mutters, shaking his head. "That one's always been
  slippery."
  
  You scan the room, but there's no sign of the stranger. Your aggressive
  approach has cost you a potential ally - and any information he might have
  shared.
  
  Perhaps you'll have another chance to find him later.
