title: "A Voice in the Dark"

description: |
  Your voice echoes into the darkness of the dungeon entrance.

  For a long moment, nothing responds.

  Then - a high-pitched cackling sound emerges from the depths.

  "More foolish adventurers!" a nasally voice shrieks. "The master will be pleased!
  Come down, come down! We'll have FUN!"

  The voice is joined by another, then another - goblins, at least a dozen
  by the sound of it.

  They know you're coming.
