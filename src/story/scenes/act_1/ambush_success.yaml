title: "Surprise Attack!"

description: |
  Your ambush is perfectly timed! As the first goblin steps through the
  entrance, you trigger your trap - a pile of loose stones crashes down
  from above, crushing two goblins instantly.
  
  The remaining goblins are thrown into chaos, screeching in panic. You
  use the confusion to strike, taking down another before they even realize
  what's happening.
  
  "Ambush! Ambush!" one goblin shrieks, but it's too late. The battle is
  already turning in your favor.
