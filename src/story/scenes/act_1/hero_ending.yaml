title: "The Hero's Welcome"

description: |
  The townspeople of the nearby village gather to celebrate your victory.
  Banners hang from every window, and a feast is prepared in your honor.

  The mysterious stranger - Aldric - stands beside you.

  "You've done what I could not," he says quietly. "The darkness is gone.
  Perhaps now I can finally find peace."

  He hands you a pouch of gold - your reward.

  You are a hero.
