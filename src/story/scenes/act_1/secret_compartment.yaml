description: |
  Your careful search reveals a loose stone in the wall. Prying it open,
  you discover a hidden compartment!

  Inside, ancient documents written in a forgotten language. And a small
  gold amulet shaped like an eye - the symbol of the old temple.

  These could be valuable... or dangerous.
