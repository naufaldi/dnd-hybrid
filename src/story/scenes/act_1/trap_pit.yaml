title: "The Pit"

description: |
  The floor gives way beneath your feet! You tumble down into darkness...

  THUD.

  You land on soft earth - a pit trap, but padded with years of debris.
  You can stand, but the walls are smooth - climbing out won't be easy.

  Above, you can hear water dripping. You're somewhere near the underground lake.
