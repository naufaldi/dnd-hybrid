title: "The Dungeon Awaits"

description: |
  You stand before the gaping entrance of the ancient dungeon. A cold wind escapes 
  from within, carrying the scent of earth and something else... something old.
  
  Torches flicker on either side of the entrance, casting dancing shadows on the 
  moss-covered stones.
