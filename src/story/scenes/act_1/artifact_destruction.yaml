  You study the sketches in Aldric's journal, noting the detailed diagrams
  of the Void Heart's structure. There's a specific weakness - a stress
  point where a precisely placed strike could shatter the crystal.
  
  "The Heart can't be destroyed by normal means," Aldric confirms. "But
  there's a ritual - dangerous, but effective. It would destroy the Heart
  and seal the doorway it opens."
  
  He looks at you seriously. "The problem is location. The ritual must be
  performed at the Heart's birthplace - deep in the temple, in the chamber
  where it was originally created. And the cultists have that area heavily
  guarded."
  
  "Are you prepared to fight through them to destroy this thing once and
  for all?"
