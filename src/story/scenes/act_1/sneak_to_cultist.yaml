title: "Silent Approach"

description: |
  You press yourself against the cold stone wall, moving with practiced
  silence. The cultists' chanting grows louder as you approach, but their
  attention is entirely focused on the dark ritual before them.
  
  The cultist leader stands before a shrine of twisted black stone, holding
  something that pulses with sickly purple light - the Void Heart. Around
  him, five robed figures chant in a language that hurts to hear.
  
  You're close enough to strike now. The element of surprise is yours.
