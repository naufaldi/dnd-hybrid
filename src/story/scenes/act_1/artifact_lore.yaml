title: "The Artifact's History"

description: |
  Aldric seems pleased by your curiosity. He settles back in his chair,
  lowering his voice.
  
  "The artifact is called the Void Heart - a crystal sphere about the size
  of a human head. It was created centuries ago by a cult that worshipped
  the spaces between stars."
  
  He pulls out a worn journal, showing you sketches of strange symbols.
  
  "The Void Heart can... thin the barrier between worlds. Open doorways to
  places that should remain sealed. The original cultists were destroyed
  by what they unleashed. The temple was built to contain both the Heart
  and the... things... that came through."
  
  He closes the journal.
  
  "Now a new cult has found it. They're trying to finish what the ancients
  started. We cannot allow that."
