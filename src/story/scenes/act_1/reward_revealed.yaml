  Aldric nods approvingly at your pragmatic approach.
  
  "A fair question. Yes, there is reward - though perhaps not what you expect."
  
  He reaches into his cloak and produces a small leather pouch, tossing it to you.
  The jingle of coins is unmistakable.
  
  "Twenty gold now. Another eighty when the artifact is recovered - if it still
  exists. And it does exist. I've seen the cultists carrying fragments of it."
  
  He pauses, his expression turning serious.
  
  "But the true reward is stopping what they're planning. These cultists serve
  something... old. Something that should have stayed buried."
