title: "The Old Armory"

description: |
  You push open the heavy wooden door. Inside, you find what was once
  an armory - racks of weapons, now corroded with age.

  Most are beyond saving, but among the ruins, you spot something:
  A longsword with a crystal pommel. Despite centuries underground,
  it gleams as if recently polished.

  The blade hums with magical energy.
