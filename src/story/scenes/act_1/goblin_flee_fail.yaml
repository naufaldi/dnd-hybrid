title: "Failed Escape"

description: |
  You try to dodge past the charging goblins, but they're faster than they look!
  
  A scimitar catches your arm, opening a painful gash. You stumble, and the
  goblins swarm around you, cutting off all escape routes.
  
  "No run! No run!" the lead goblin cackles. "You fight now!"
  
  You have no choice but to defend yourself.
