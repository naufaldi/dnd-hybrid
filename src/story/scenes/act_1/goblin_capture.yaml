title: "Prisoner of the Goblins"

description: |
  You drop your weapon and raise your hands in surrender. The goblins swarm
  around you, cackling with glee as they bind your hands with rough rope.
  
  "Smart human!" the leader grins, showing yellowed teeth. "Live longer this way!"
  
  They drag you deeper into the dungeon, through twisting passages that reek
  of filth and decay. Finally, they throw you into a makeshift cage of rusted
  iron bars.
  
  "Master come soon," one goblin cackles as they leave you in the dark.
  "Master like fresh meat!"
  
  You are trapped, wounded, and at the mercy of whatever "master" the goblins
  serve. Your situation is dire.
