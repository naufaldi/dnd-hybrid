title: "Ancient Understanding"

description: |
  You lower your weapon and raise your hands in a gesture of peace. The
  massive plesiosaur watches you with ancient, intelligent eyes.
  
  "I mean no harm, great one," you say softly. "I seek only to stop those
  who disturbed your rest."
  
  The creature makes a low rumbling sound - almost musical. It seems to
  understand. Slowly, it lowers its long neck, and you sense a connection
  forming between you.
  
  Through some ancient magic or simple understanding, you realize this
  creature has guarded the temple for centuries. It recognizes you as
  different from the cultists - someone who respects the old ways.
  
  The guardian moves aside, allowing you access to a passage behind its lair.
