  The stranger's eyes narrow thoughtfully as you ask about the dungeon.

  "Very well," he whispers, leaning closer. "The dungeon below this town was once
  a temple to an old god - one best left forgotten. Three weeks ago, the entrance
  appeared overnight. No one knows why."

  He slides a crude map across the table.

  "The temple complex extends deep underground. I've heard whispers of cultists
  performing rituals in the lower chambers. If something isn't done, the entire
  region will be consumed by darkness."

  The map shows three main areas: the entrance hall, the eastern passages
  (marked "water danger"), and the western wing (marked "armory").
