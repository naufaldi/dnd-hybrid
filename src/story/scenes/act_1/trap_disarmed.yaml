title: "Trap Disabled"

description: |
  Working carefully, you examine the pressure plate's mechanism. The trigger
  is surprisingly sophisticated - a series of counterweights designed to
  release when enough weight is applied.
  
  With steady hands, you wedge a small stone beneath the plate's support,
  preventing it from depressing fully. You test your work by gently pressing
  on the stone - the plate doesn't budge.
  
  "Nicely done," you mutter to yourself, stepping carefully over the disabled
  trap. The entrance hall beyond awaits, its secrets ready to be discovered.
