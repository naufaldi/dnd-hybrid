title: "A Lucky Find"

description: |
  Your fingers work the rusted lock mechanism. With a satisfying click,
  it opens!

  Inside, you find:
  - 25 gold pieces (an adventurer's hoard, long forgotten)
  - A potion of healing
  - A small brass key with strange markings

  The key bears the symbol of the old temple - it may open something
  deeper in the dungeon.
