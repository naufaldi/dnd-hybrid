title: "Surprise Attack!"

description: |
  You burst from the shadows with a battle cry, striking down the nearest
  cultist before they can react. The chanting stops abruptly as the robed
  figures scatter in confusion.
  
  The cultist leader spins around, his eyes wide with shock and rage. He
  clutches the Void Heart tightly, its purple light pulsing wildly.
  
  "You fool!" he screams. "Do you know what you've interrupted? The ritual
  was almost complete!"
  
  He thrusts the artifact toward you, and you feel a wave of cold dread
  wash over you. But there's no turning back now.
