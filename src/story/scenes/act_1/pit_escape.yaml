title: "Freedom at Last"

description: |
  You dig your fingers into the rough stone walls, finding purchase in ancient
  cracks and crevices. With a surge of strength, you pull yourself upward,
  muscles burning with the effort.
  
  Hand over hand, you climb. Your sprained ankle throbs with each movement,
  but you grit your teeth and push through the pain.
  
  Finally, your fingers grasp the edge of the pit. With one final heave,
  you drag yourself over the rim and collapse on the stone floor of the
  dungeon entrance, gasping for breath.
  
  You're free, though battered and bruised.
