title: "The Stranger's Offer"

description: |
  The stranger nods slowly, a hint of relief crossing his weathered features.

  "I knew you were different," he says. "The dungeon has attracted many would-be
  heroes - all dead within a day. But you... you have a certain quality."

  He reaches into his cloak and produces a small, glowing amulet.

  "Take this. It will protect you from the dungeon's darker influences. But know
  this - the temple below holds an artifact of great power. The cultists seek
  to awaken it."

  He leans back.

  "If you succeed in stopping them, return to me. I have a reward worthy of
  a true hero."
