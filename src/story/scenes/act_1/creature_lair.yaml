title: "The Creature's Lair"

description: |
  You follow the tracks along the underground lake shore. They lead to a
  cavern opening on the far side of the water...

  ...where a massive shape stirs.

  A plesiosaur - an ancient aquatic reptile the size of a small boat -
  rises from the dark waters. Its long neck swivels, and cold eyes fix
  upon you.

  This creature has been here for centuries - a guardian of the old temple,
  awakened by the cultists' rituals.
