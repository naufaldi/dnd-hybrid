description: |
  You move carefully across the weathered boards, testing each step before
  committing your weight. The dock creaks ominously but holds.

  On the far shore, you find an ancient door set into the rock face.
  The brass lock catches your eye - the same symbol as the temple.

  This passage leads directly into the deeper levels of the dungeon.
