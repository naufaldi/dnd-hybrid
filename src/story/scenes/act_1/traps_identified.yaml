title: "The Safe Path"

description: |
  Your keen eyes spot the danger just in time. The floor ahead is trapped - pressure
  plates that would trigger a hail of arrows or worse.
  
  You carefully navigate around the deadly mechanism, marking safe spots as you go.
  Your thorough approach has paid off.
  
  Beyond the trap, the passage continues into darkness. You've gained valuable
  knowledge about dungeon traps.
