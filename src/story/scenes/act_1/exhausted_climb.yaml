title: "Too Weak to Continue"

description: |
  You try to climb out of the pit, but your wounds are too severe. Each attempt
  leaves you more exhausted than before. Your grip slips, and you fall back
  to the bottom with a groan.
  
  Blood loss and exhaustion overwhelm you. The world spins, and darkness creeps
  in at the edges of your vision.
  
  You collapse against the cold stone wall, unable to go on.
  
  Your adventure ends here, in the dark, alone.
